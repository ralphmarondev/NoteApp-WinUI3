# NoteApp 📝

A simple WinUI 3 practice project for building a **note‑taking application**.  
This project is part of my personal learning journey — I’m experimenting with layouts, navigation, and UI polish. Expect
things to change often as I keep refining and updating it.

## ✨ Features (so far)

- **New Note Page**: add a title and content, save via command binding.
- **Note List Page**: displays notes in a card/grid layout for a clean modern look.
- **Window Helper**: utility for resizing, centering, and enforcing minimum window size.
- **Navigation Shell**: basic `NavigationView` switching between pages.

## 🚧 Status

This is **just for practice**.  
I’m still polishing the UI, experimenting with layouts, and improving the overall structure.  
Suggestions, ideas, and constructive feedback are very welcome!
